# creditcarddefault
This project predicts credit card defaults using a Naive Bayes Classifier on client data, including credit limits, payment history, and demographics. It involves data cleaning, EDA, and model evaluation to assess default risk, supporting proactive interventions and informed credit decisions.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing the features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Examined feature distributions and identified key patterns influencing defaults.
Naive Bayes Model: Trained a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict client defaults and evaluated its performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
